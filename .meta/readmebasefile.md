# TIL

TIL (Today I Learned), is a collection of  snippets and general gathered information on topics of life and tech through pure happenstance.
This is more akin to a MindMap or Second Brain, than any kind of formal formatted bibliographic resource. So be advised of the possibility of encountering a mix of texts, written in a plethora of languages and organized in different reading structures.
In any case I believe knowledge should be free, and any piece of information can and should be added to the whole. That way, we all can be “standing on the shoulders of giants” and collectively pave a more easy way to understanding the world





## About
- Originally inspired (Derived) by [simonw/til](https://github.com/simonw/til) and [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).
- The Readme File is constantly rebuilt by [buildreadme.py](.meta/buildreadme.py). The script parses the directory structure and concatenates the generated listing with the base [readme file](.meta/basereadme.md).

## Roadmap
- Maybe add a Github Action to automatically build the index
- Maybe add a Github.io page containing the summary and content (as in [OpenResources](https://github.com/thethales/OpenResources)).
