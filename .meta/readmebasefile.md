# TIL

TIL (Today I Learned), a collection of  snippets and general gathered information on topics of life and tech trough pure happenstance.


## About
- Originally inspired (Derived) by [simonw/til](https://github.com/simonw/til) and [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).
- The Readme File is constantly rebuilt by [buildreadme.py](.meta/buildreadme.py). The script parses the directory structe and concatenates the listing with the base [readme file](.meta/basereadme.md). For utility purposes the JSON generated during the parsing is also saved in the directory, being available for direct consulting.

## Roadmap
- Add a Github Action to automatically build the index
- Maybe add a Github.io page containing the summary and content (as in (OpenResources)[https://github.com/thethales/OpenResources]).
