## Mnemonic About Include & Extend

I often use this to remember the two:

My use case: I am going to the city.

```
includes -> drive the car

extends -> fill the petrol
```

"Fill the petrol" may not be required at all times, but may optionally be required based on the amount of petrol left in the car. "Drive the car" is a prerequisite hence I am including.
